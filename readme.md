# Geocode-csv

A simple application to geocode a list of place names.

Using the gmap geocode api (and your own api key), geocode a csv column of place names, and create a new csv with lat and lng added.

To run, fill out the config.ini file with your google maps api key, the path to your csv file, and the column name with location info (usually addresses).
